## Summary

In this article, I show you how to create a basic hamburger menu layout for iOS, Android and UWP by Xamarin.Forms and MvvmCross Framework. I am not a professional designer so you might need to fine-tune the styles for your own applications. I hope you can follow these steps to create a hamburger menu layout with a clean, graceful MVVM architecture. Also, I would like you could get data-binding fundamentals from my demo. Bear in mind that there might be more than one approach to achieve the same goal, and my implementation is not the best one. if you find a better solution, please leave comments and discuss it.

You can find the repo on my GitHub: [MvxFormsMasterDetailDemo](https://github.com/yanxiaodi/MvvmCrossDemo/tree/master/MvxFormsMasterDetailDemo). Happy coding!
