# Summary

In this article, I created a simple `Xamarin` project with the `MvvmCross` framework, including the `Xamarin Native` and the `Xamarin.Forms`. It is simple enough to understand the fundamental of `MvvmCross`. For a `Xamarin` beginner, sometimes it is tricky, but I believe that we can find out the solutions with the supports of the community. There are a lot of features of the `Xamarin` and the `MvvmCross` that I did not mention in this article, such as the `ValueConverter`, the plugins, etc. I will write more articles about this. Start from here to develop your first cross-platform application and happy coding!
